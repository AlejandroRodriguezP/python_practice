'''
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example,
 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

# Variables
number = int(input("please enter a number "))

# Logic
for x in range(1, int(number / 2 + 1)):
    if number % x == 0:
        print(x)
